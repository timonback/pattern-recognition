# Lab 2: Assignment 1

Consider the following set of feature vectors:

[4 5 6]
[6 3 9]
[8 7 3]
[7 4 8]
[4 6 5]

Hint: We consider a feature vector to be a vector of values of measurements of different features of an object. So here we have five measurements (the five vectors) of three features; the first feature having values 4, 6, 8, 7, and 4, the second feature having values 5, 3, 7, 4, and 6 and the third feature having values 6, 9, 3, 8, and 5.

1. Compute the means of the features.

2. Compute the biased covariance matrix  C of the set of feature. We use the notation Ci,j to denote an element of the covariance matrix, where i denotes the row index and j the column index of the matrix.
