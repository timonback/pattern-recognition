# Lab 2: Assignment 5

Consider two two-dimensional normal distributions with means [3 5] and [2 1] and covariance matrices [1 0; 0 4] and [2 0; 0 1] respectively. Let the prior be P left parenthesis w subscript 1 right parenthesis equals 0.3 and p left parenthesis w subscript 2 right parenthesis equals 0.7. Given these two normal distributions and the prior probabilities, new data can be classified using discriminant functions based on these distributions.
